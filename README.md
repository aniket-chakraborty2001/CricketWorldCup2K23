# Project Name: CricketWorldCup2K23

In this project, I try to find hidden patterns that are in the data set. Here I use spreadsheet to collect data and store data in a tabular format. I use Python as my primary tool to do Basic Data Exploration and Data Manipulation Task. I use SQL to fetch data of various interests from the data set. After that, I make visualizations by using the data to get meaningful insights from that. Here I use Python as my choice. As an extension of the project, I use tableau to make interactice visualizations and Dashboard to gather attention on my Tableau Public Skill set. I also use the Python Folium package to make Map and point out the stadiums in the Map. This completes my project. In the last step, I make a Power point presentation. As a data scientist, presenting my findings and my understanding to stakeholders is very esstential. In this project I am considering the Journalists that are interested in knwoing the different aspects of world cup, so that they can write on them in their work.

## Step By Step Project Works: 
In this project, their are total 6 notebooks. Here I am going to mention them in the appropriate ordering.

  * 1. Data Exploration Notebook
  * 2. Data Manipulation Notebook
  * 3. Data Analysis with SQL Notebook
  * 4. Data Visualization Notebook
  * 5. Tableau Interactive Visualization Notebook
  * 6. Stadiums of World Cup Notebook
  * 7. Presenting the Findings

## About the Data set:
The data set which is used in this project is organised by me. These informations are available in Online. It kaes me about 1 months and 15 days to Collect all the important information during the world cup. In this project, two .csv files are attached. The one named 'WorldCup2K23Data_OriginalData.csv' is the original csv file with many missing values. I process it to make it clean and easy to use. The processesd and manipulated data set has zero missing values. It is named as 'WorldCup2K23_WrangledData.csv'.
